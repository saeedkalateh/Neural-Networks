plotcl(X,t)
X (n x d)
t (n x 1)
plots the data in X as in plotdata(X) but with different colors and styles according to the label t
(i.e., X(i,:) is plotted with a style defined by t(i)).
labels must be consecutive integer numbers starting at 1
(actually if they are not consecutive it works anyway, you just waste some of the available styles)

plotcl(X,t,coord)
coord a vector of 1 to 3 column indexes
Specify this third argument if you don√†t want to plot the first columns.
